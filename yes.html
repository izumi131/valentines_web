    <p>
      Hehe I know you'd say yes. 
      But I want this chance to say that I love you very much baby💖
      and I'm super grateful to have you in my life.
      For all the things you do for me, big and small, thank you so much.
      You are so precious babe and I will always cherish you.
      You are always there to reassure me when i'm down and 
      you even cry just cuz u are worried about me.
      I hope I can do the same for you too.
      I promise to always be by your side no matter what happens.
      Thank you for being the best girlfriend ever 💕
